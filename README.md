# Student Organization Governance DAO
Deployed on Stacks Testnet: ST2ZR3R5T65RHDW0EX4KEBYFZ1N0QV7V2KY31F5PK.student-organization-governance
## Project Summary
This project is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) built on the Stacks blockchain, designed to improve transparency and governance for student organizations. It provides a secure and automated platform for members to participate in decision-making and track organizational finances.

## Problem Statement
The Problem in Indonesia
Student organizations in Indonesia often face challenges with a lack of transparency and accountability in fund usage and decision-making processes.

Who is Affected?
Members of student organizations, executive committees, and the entire student body who are constituents.

Why is This Problem Important?
A lack of transparency and low participation can decrease member motivation, erode trust, and hinder the organization's growth and development.

Current Solution & Its Limitations
How is this solved today?
Decisions are typically made through manual meetings or by a small group of core executives. Financial reports are created in physical documents or spreadsheets that are not easily accessible to all members.

What are the current solution's drawbacks?
The process is inefficient, leads to low member participation, and reports are not publicly verifiable, making them prone to bias or errors.

## Solution Overview
The Smart Contract Solution
We are building a DAO on the Stacks blockchain that records all proposals (including fund allocations), voting processes, and decision executions in a permanent and transparent manner. A weighted-vote system ensures that voting power is distributed fairly based on a member's status or role within the organization.

Why is this better than the conventional solution?
All data is immutably recorded on the blockchain, making it tamper-proof and auditable by anyone. The automation of the voting and execution processes makes the system more efficient and eliminates unwanted manual intervention.

## Value Proposition
Benefit for Users (Members)
Members gain a verified and transparent voice in every important decision.

Members can monitor the use of funds in real-time.

Benefit for the Ecosystem
The project serves as a pilot model for decentralized and transparent governance in an educational environment.

It creates a foundation for building future dApps and tokenization within the campus ecosystem.
